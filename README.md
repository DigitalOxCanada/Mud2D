Walkthrough for beginner coders for learning C# to make a game.  

I made this set of lessons mainly to help someone out learning C#.  It was an off the top of the head idea to go with and absolutely no planning was put into place.  This was intentional by design.  Going through the lessons you will get to see how ideas can start simple and small and mutate into bigger, better and more structured.  If you can follow the changes from lesson to lesson you will see the thought process of where and how I needed to make changes for the better.  I chose text graphics so that anyone learning from these lessons doesn't get bogged down with graphic engines which are complex and very involved.  With minimal graphic representation the focus is on the C# code to make the game work.  The game `Sword of Fargoal` was the main inspiration.  

I hope anyone wanting to learn C# and the basics of object oriented programming and game development find these lessons helpful.
