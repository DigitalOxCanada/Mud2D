# Lesson Notes

1. Added PickableObjects to tiles.  Now you can pick up gold found on the map.

2. Monster AI now will go after the player if close enough. Just moving based on delta location isn't perfect until true path finding is performed.

3. Improved Monster PossibleMoves array to make the code easier to understand.
