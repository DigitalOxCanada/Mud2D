# Lesson Notes

1. Change GameEngine to be a static class usable everywhere instead of passing the instance in many of the methods.

2. Changed PickableObject to ActionObject.  

3. Made Gold, Teleport, tiles, monsters, players, etc. based on ObjectBase.

4. Created ScoreCard to show player stats.

5. Added `#if FOW` so we can test easier without FOW on.
